# 🧠 MNIST Digit Classifier

This is a simple neural network built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It's a beginner-friendly project to learn the basics of machine learning and deep learning.

---

## 📌 Features

- Loads and visualizes the MNIST dataset
- Normalizes the input data
- Trains 3 different neural network models:
  1. Single layer with sigmoid activation
  2. Hidden layer with ReLU
  3. Flattened input with dense layers
- Evaluates accuracy
- Visualizes confusion matrix using seaborn

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib seaborn numpy

## Run the script:
python mnist_digit_classifier.py
```

---

## 📊 Output Example
-Accuracy up to ~97%

-Confusion matrix heatmap for visual analysis of predictions
